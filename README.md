# Individual Mining

ALYA Mining is basically created by combining two systems (Proof of Stake & Proof of Active) and anyone in the world can start ALYA Mining with an average PC.

Since ALYA Mining program is based on Proof of Stake and Proof of Active, it does not need any extra power usage, energy expenditure or hardware power. Only the energy consumption of your computer is sufficient for mining. ALYA Mining is also possible on Virtual Computers, although it is not recommended by us for security reasons.

500 ALYA is the minimum Stake Amount for Individual Mining.
